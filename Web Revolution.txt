						Web Revolution 
		Angular and React 

		a. What is a web revolution (2015-16)
			This is a complete change in how users use the internet 
			and accordingly developers changed the way they need to create web contents

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		1. when did you use the internet firsttime ? - me in 2001
			world average is 2004 

		2. how did you use the internet (devise) - Desktop / Laptop, browsers(IE)
		3. where did they use the internet - cafe, libraries, college etc..
		4. source of internet - broadband
		5. why did they use internet - (surfing, checking result, play games, Orkut.com,yahoo messenger)
		
			Thus developers will create web contents accordngly

	somewhere in 2012-13, use of internet boomed(10 times), which became major challange for developers\

		- how do you use the internet - phone, tabltes, watch, AC, refregirator, car,  laptop
		- where do people use internet - everywhere 
		- source - mobile data, wifi, routers, 
		- why do people use internet - everything
		
		- phone, tabltes, watch, AC, refregirator, car,  laptop
			a. developers now need to create RESPONSIVE content, fit every size 
			b. harware intgration - integrate with cameras, audio, photos, navigator
			c. speed of iternet - content shoud be very lightweight nd fast
			d. kind of applications 
		- where do people use internet - everywhere 
		- source - mobile data, wifi, routers, 
		- why do people use internet - everything
		- habbits of treating the contents changed -images, videos,  

--------------------------------------
			we did not had a technology in place to hadle this kind of change
				different architectures came as a recommendation 
			and thus it became crutial to come up with a different mindset
		
		previously developers created server centric applications
		now they need to create client centeric application - less roundtrips, client side filtering, sorting, caculations,storing the whole site on clients devise
			cookies, localstorage, sessionstorage

		storage and processor is a massive change 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			All this changes led developers/companies/clients into big problem
		and that is where W3C, ECMA has to jump in, and brought in a massive frameworks which supports
			- light weight content
			- responsive
			- simple and faster development 
			- reduce the roundtrips etc..


	W3C and ecma came with - HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, ES and other communities came with more such libraries
	Facebook - React, they purchased a community which developed Redux
	Microsoft - AngularJS (MVC design patter, super nice library)
	Google - Node
	Google gave - Angular - basd on Component development pattern 
			the eco system is now different for developing web contents
	Microsoft - Typescript
		patterns - dependency injection, SPA, REST(JSON is super light)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Angular ecosystem (must know what, why, where, how and about)
			components
			pipes
			services
			decorators
			spa

	be prepated on the same with what, why, where, how and when and where did you use it in your 
		capstone project
			
	integration with other UI libraties is great (bootstrap, Material)
