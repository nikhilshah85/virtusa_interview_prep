		If you need to interact with Rest calls without using Angular or react, how will you make a
		interaction

		ES got you a new light weight method fetch which will make calls easy 

		fetch is a standard JS / ES method to make such calls

		Thus make a call to below url and display the data 

		have a web page, HTML5 with a textbox, make a fetch call to below
		here user will enter a number (1 to 20) and press a tab, which will display the product

		https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{number} 
		
		make a impressive page for the same 
		display image in round share, 150 150 px

		when user hovers on the image make it 400 400 px in square shape


			Take a break : 11:55 - 12:10



		1. Create a webpage where user will input their name and choose gender from UI
		2. on the press of tab, display their name in below font
			https://www.webpagepublicity.com/free-fonts/a/Alix2.ttf
		3. apply font color, border color, shadow bigger size then h1, display it on right of the page (use 				float property)
			do a animation (we want to see the creativity)
				eg, change the border color every 2 sec - use 6-7 colors
					or make the name blink, or fade in fade out effect

		 4. use pink color for female gender and skyblue/aqua color for male as a background color for text
			also display shadow
