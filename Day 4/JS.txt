					Browsers
				1. HTML (UI)
				2. CSS (Decoration)
				3. JS (Client interactions, client side validations, client side formatting
						client side calculations, saving client side data(cookies, state management, to make api calls)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		1. JavaScript is a scripting language for client side 
			Client interactions, client side validations, client side formatting
						client side calculations, saving client side data(cookies, 				state management, to make api calls)
		2. it is based on W3C Standards and all the browsers has to support it
		3. Some of the disadvantages
			a. No support for OOPS 
			b. No compiled (runtime execution)
			c. Not enough datatypes
			d. JavaScript runs on  single thread
			e. add Slow DOM and slow rendering with HTML
			f. logic gets visible on the browser very easily, thus cannot use any business logic 				or algo as it can be easily copied
			
		all of the able is now been taken care by ECMA script

		We now have Ecma Script which is OOPS based it supports all the features of modern programming language like Java, C++, C#, etc...

		ES has only 1 challenge,difficult to write and underand for developers, which makes if very less convinent to use and find the resources, (it is very very powerful although)
		
	Thus Microsoft came in, created a wrapper on ES, allowing programmers to use it in the same way like java and C#, thus they write the code in Java style, but the compiler will covert it into ES
		This new wrapped language on ES is called Typescript
