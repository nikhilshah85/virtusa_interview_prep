						Databases

	MySQL - RDBMS 
	----------------------------------------
		Normalization (GBS of Data)
			1st NF
			2nd NF
			3rd NF

		Denormalization (used for data analytics for TBs of data)
			4th NF
			5th NF
			6th NF

	-------------------------------------------
	SQL - Structured Query Language
	PLSQL / TSQL - Adds programming abilities like loops, conditions, exception handling, compilation, 
				automation, encapsulation etc...

	-------------------------------------------
DDL
			Create
		tables, views, procedures, functions, triggers, cursor, users, roles, schema, files, etc..
			Alter
			to modify anything from above
			Drop
			to remove from the database 
DML
		insert, update, delete
DQL 
		select
			all columns
			limited columns
			colums with alias, (different headers)
			with calculation 
			with functions (aggregate functions, string, date, etc..)
			with order by
			with where clause
			with group by
			with Joins
				inner join / equi join
				left join
				right join
				cross join
				null join 
				self join
			with nested query	
TCL
	commit (control + S)
	rollback (control + z)
	savepoint (autosave)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Plz do everything with code, try not to use any UI (right click create table)
		create below tables
			a. branchInfo
				branchNo (Primary key)
				branchName (whitefield)
				branchCity (Bangalore)
			   add 5 branches
			b. accountsInfo
				accNo (primary key)
				accName (needs to be minimum 3 characters)
				accType (only Savings, current and PF)
				accBalance (minimum 500)
				accIsActive (true or false)
				accBranch (foreign key to branchInfo)
			   add 20 records here

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			Write the quesries for below
1. show all the branches
2. show accno and name from accounts
3. display 'Respected ' accName has an accType account with us in accBranchno having balance of accbalance
4. display all the savings account
5. increase accBalance by 10% for savings, 
			  15% for current
			  20% for PF
	do it in a single query 

6. display Total balance for all the account types
	Savings 800000
	Current 190000
	PF      500000
7. display all the accounts which are inactive
8. display all the accounts who has balance less than 20000 and name starts with N (or any character)
9. display the accounts which are savings and current having balance less than 20000 
10, display all the accounts which have balance less than the average of all the accounts
	meaning : if avg(accbalance) = 30000, display accounts with balance less than 30000
11. display all the accounts from branch and accountsbalance 
	(cartisian product) - this helps to measure perrmance
12. display equal accounts from both the tables
13. display total balance for all the branches based on names
	Marathalli 400000
	Hi-TechCity 80000
	Bandra     ---
	TNagar	   ---
14. display total accounts in all the cities
15. display average balance per account based on on branchno and branchname
16. display which branch has the highest balance
17. display accName has account in branchName
 
				Break : 11:45 - 12:00 
18. About joins
	add 3 more account in the branch table
	add 5 accounts in accounts table (keep accountBranch as null)

19. select all the account from accounts table (25 accounts) along with all the columns in the branch table
	but only accounts which has branches, do not display the branch which does not have branchNo
20. select only account along with branchtable columns which does not have branchNo
21. display summary of total accounts for all the branches, display NA for nulls
22. display all the accounts and branches (single occurance) = total 33 rows
23. display all the accounts and branches with null values only
24. create the email id for all account in below format
	firstname.lastname@branchname.first2characters_of_branch
	the email id should be lower (use lower function only 1ce in the query)
25. display which branch has the lowest number of account
26. display which city has the highest no of accounts
27. display name of the branch which has the account with highest accBalance
28. display which city has lowest balance as average of all the account balance

		After you finish the above code activity,
		please go throught both the PPTS from day 2 folder

	Project Activity :
	Create a SPRINGBOOT REST API application for the banking System
	where you will connect to MySQL Database and it will allow 
		GET, PUT, POST and Delete actions from rest connected to the database that you just 
		designed in the above activity
