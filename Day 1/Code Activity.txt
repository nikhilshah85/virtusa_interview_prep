Java fundnamentals
OOPS
Exception handling
Collections
Threading and Stream API 
----------------------------------------------------
					Task Activity on Task(Java) 
1. Create a new Java(.exe) application, bankingAPP_yourname
2. Have a class, Accounts to have getter and setter properties for (Abstract class)
	accNo, accName, accType, accBalance,accIsActive
3. Have methods
	checkBalance -- return the current balance
	withdraw(amount) -- ask user how much needs to be withdrawn
	deposit(amount) -- ask user how much needs to be withdrawn
4. Have child classes Savings, current, PF
	override methods withdraw and deposit, 
	making sure 
		- savings cannot withdraw more than 5000 in a transaction (no more than availbal)
	        - Current cannot withdraw more than 25000 in a transaction 
				it will have a getter and setter - isOdEnabled
					if enabled they can withdraw even more than their avail balance
					eg. if they have only 10K they can still get 15K and final bal will
					become -15K (only if odEnabled = true)
		- PF can withdraw max 70% available balance 
5. create an interface before classes and implement it on Accounts class	

		try to 
		a. apply as many validations where ever u can 
		b. follow naming conventions - keep your code neat and clean as much as possible
		c. include comments if you feel


when you run the project, it will have a screen 
	!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Welcome to BankName ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ !!
	1. Create Account
	2. Check Balance
	3. Withdraw
	4. Deposit
	5. Exit

apply a loop which keep the project running until user selects 5

	---once done
		create a new git repo - upload your project and share the repo link

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Stage 2

1. implement exceptions 
2. For create account, ask user which type of accounts
	a. Savings
	b. Current
	c. PF
		(handle exception if user provides any other value)
	keep the application running until user says exit
3. Auto Generate the account Numbers - do not ask user to enter the accNo
	Savings will have a sequence - SA101 and next will be SA102
	current will have a sequence - CA501 ....
	PF will have a sequence      - PF2001 ......
